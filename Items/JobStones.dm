// ==========================================================================
// JOB STONES
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A Job Stone is a craftable Enchantment item behind the ToolEnchantment magic
// knowledge. EnchType places it in the Tool Enchantment section of the Access
// Enchantment menu (which requires ToolEnchantment); SubType="Any" adds no
// further requirement.
//
// Holding a Job Stone grants the "Attune to Job" verb. Attuning activates a
// Special Buff that OVERWRITES the character's base stats with the Job baked
// into that stone. Deactivating it (same verb again) reverts every stat to
// its stored original value and frees the Special Buff slot.
//
// Adding a new Job = one buff subtype (its stat block) + one stone subtype
// pointing at it. The example jobs below (Warrior / Mage / Rogue) use
// placeholder numbers meant to be tuned.
// ==========================================================================

// --- stat overwrite / restore plumbing -----------------------------------
// The "stats" a player allocates at creation live in modifier vars, mapped by
// SetStat(). GetJobStatValue() is the read-side mirror of that mapping so we
// can snapshot the originals before overwriting them.
